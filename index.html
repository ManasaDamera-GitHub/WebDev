    <h1>Frontend technologies</h1>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <h4>Version:</h4>
    <p>Introduced: 1993 <br>

        Current: HTML5</p>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
        It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
        Hypertext defines the link between web pages.</p>
    <h4>Applications</h4>
    <p>Used to structure a web page.<br>
        Forms and Input Elements<br>
        Images and Multimedia (img, audio, video)<br>
        Links and Anchor Tags <br>
        Tables for Structured Data<br>
        Accessibility Features (alt text, ARIA attributes)</p>
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <h4>Version</h4>
    <p>Introduced: 17 December 1996<br>

        Current: CSS3</p>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to styles web pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred to as CSS.
        The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply
        styles on web pages. </p>
    <h4>Applications</h4>
    <p>Styling Web Pages<br>
        Responsive Web Design<br>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <h4>Version</h4>
    <p>Introduced: May 29, 2013<br>
        Current: 18.2.0</p>
    <p>ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is an
        open-source, component-based front-end library that is responsible only for the view layer of the application.
        ReactJS is not a framework, it is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that we were
        facing earlier.</p>
    <h4>Applications</h4>

    <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
    <h4>Version</h4>
    <p>Introduced: August 2011.<br>
        Current: 5.3.2</p>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Bootstrap is a widely-used open-source front-end framework for web development, providing a collection of HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript components and tools that enable developers to build responsive, mobile-first websites with
        ease.</p>
    <h4>Applications</h4>
    <p>Responsive Grid System<br>
        Pre-Styled Components<br>
        CSS and JavaScript Components<br>
        Bootstrap Themes and Templates<br>
        Mobile-First Design Approach</p>
    <h1>Backend-technologies</h1>
    <h2>Node.js</h2>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript framework that is used to build server-side and networking
        applications. Node.js is built using Google’s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js provides various JavaScript modules
        and integration with various third-party libraries and APIs to develop web applications easily and efficiently.

        The Node.js framework makes it easy for developers to write command-line tools and server scripts with the help
        of JavaScript.</p>
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <p>High Performance: Node.js can create high-performance applications that can execute in less time. It enables the
        non-blocking of I/O tasks which increases the speed of code execution.<br>
        Scalability: Node.js provides growth of applications in both vertical and horizontal orientations. Vertical
        scaling is done by allowing the addition of extra resources to single nodes. Horizontal scaling is done by
        allowing the addition of nodes to the existing system.<br>
        Rich Community: The online community of Node.js helps developers whenever they are stuck on any piece of code.
        Big companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc, have also contributed to the Node.js community.<br>
        Reduced Loading Time: Node.js uses caching which decreases the loading time and code re-execution.</p>
    <h2>Django</h2>
    <p>Django is an open-source framework based on Python. It is a web framework from the server’s side. Django follows
        the Model Template View (MTV) architecture. It focuses on the reuse of code, an easy and fast development
        process with minimal coupling. This allows the developers to look at and learn about any functionality in an
        easy way instead of searching it online.</p>
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <p>Rich Community: Django has a rich community of developers who help that users who are stuck and resolve their
        issues.<br>
        Documentation: Django provides precise and organized documentation divided into various sections for
        developers.<br>
        Security: Django provides high security of accounts and data with the help of a user authentication system,
        protection from SQL injection, etc.<br>
        Versatility: Django is flexible in handling all types of complicated tasks like data analysis, machine learning,
        etc.</p>
    <h2> Spring Boot</h2>
    <p>Spring Boot is an open-source web framework based on Java that allows developers to build production-grade and
        standalone applications. It is free to use. It makes use of a micro-framework that helps in developing
        microservices for websites and mobile applications.

        Spring Boot requires very minimal configurations to set up and provides developers with a quick approach to
        creating and deploying applications and services. It decreases the requirement for writing XML setup and
        annotation, as well as the boilerplate code, which is code that must be included in numerous areas with little
        modification.</p>
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <p>Flexibility and scalability: Spring Boot provides high flexibility and scalability by configuring XML
        configurations.<br>
        Auto Configuration: Spring Boot has a feature of auto configuration which means that neither XML configuration
        nor code generation is required.<br>
        No need for WAR files: WAR (Web Application Resource) files can be used by Spring Boot, but they are not
        required. Instead, JAR (Java Resource) can be used by Spring Boot because of its short and simple structure
        making it very useful for developers.<br>
        Bootstrapping conserves memory: Boot Initialiser is used for compiling the source language. The technique of
        bootstrapping helps developers in conserving space on their devices and rapidly loading of applications.</p>
    <h2>PHP</h2>
    <p>PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor is a popular backend technology that is widely used for Web Development.
        Basically, it is a server-side scripting language that is primarily designed for creating dynamic web pages and
        web applications. The programs that are created in it are executed on web servers and are not dependent on an
        online browser.

        PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. PHP is considered a popular choice for backend development due to its
        simplicity, broad community support, extensive documentation, compatibility with databases, and ability to build
        robust web applications.</p>
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <p>Easy to Learn: PHP is known for its simplicity, which makes it accessible to beginners. The syntax of PHP is
        similar to that of C, Java, and other programming languages, which makes it easy to grasp.<br>
        Fast Execution: When it comes to Web Applications, speed matters. Here, PHP comes to play, Its built-in caching
        mechanism and optimization techniques make it faster in execution.<br>
        Security: PHP provides built-in functions and libraries to handle common security issues, such as cross-site
        scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks and it is significantly improving its security terms over the years.
